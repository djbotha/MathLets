# MathLets

```
applet
"aplÉªt"
noun COMPUTING
a very small application, especially a utility program performing one or a few simple functions.
"there's a useful control applet which can be used to centre the picture"
```
However, a MathLet does exactly the same! I have made this repository to make up a collection of all my tiny and semi-useless applications that I write.

Some of these are:

- [x] A class to calculate an integer `n`'s factorial.
- [x] A class the number of outcomes of choosing a subset of `k` elements from a larger set `n`.
- [ ] A class to calculate the [Knapsack Problem's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) answer
- [ ] A class to calculate the power of an `integer i` to the power of another `integer n`.

These are mostly applets I have written/will be writing during the course of my 3 year Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the [University of Stellenbosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellenbosch_University).
